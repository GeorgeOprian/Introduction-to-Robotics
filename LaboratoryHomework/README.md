## Laboratory homeworks:

1. **analogRGBControl** - this homework uses 3 potentiometers to vary the colors of an RGB led. If you add enough LED's and make them blink you can have a party globe :).
2. **KnockDetectorBuzzer** - this homework uses two buzzers, an active one and a passive one and a button. I control the passive buzzer with a knock that starts the active one, when I want to stop the buzzing I press a button that shuts down the sistem until the next knock is given.
3. **Joystick & 4 x 7-segmets dispaly** - it's a project that uses a joystick to increase or decrease the number on one of the digits of an 4*7segments dispaly.
4. **LCD menu**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBohW6gwHM&feature=youtu.be - this homework uses a joystick to scroll through a menu, and start a "game".
