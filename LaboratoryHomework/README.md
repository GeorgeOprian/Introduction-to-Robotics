Laboratory homeworks:

1. analogRGBControl.ino - this homework uses 3 potentiometers to vary the colors of an RGB led. If you add enough LED's and make them blink you can have a party globe :).
2. KnockDetectorBuzzer - this homework uses two buzzers, an active one and a passive one and a button. I control the passive buzzer with a knock that starts the active one, when I want to stop the buzzing I press a button that shuts down the sistem until the next knock is given.
